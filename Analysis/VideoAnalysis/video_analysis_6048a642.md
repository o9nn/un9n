## New Expression Category: VISION_* (Visionary/Ambitious)

| Expression ID | Description | Key Features | Semantic Context |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|

| VISION_03 | Collaborative Enthusiasm | Warm smile, engaged eyes | "We will" statements |
| VISION_04 | Triumphant Anticipation | Broad smile, elevated chin | Achievement preview |

## Semantic-Affective Correlation: Visionary Language

### The "Visionary Expression" Pattern
When speech contains ambitious/visionary language, expressions combine wonder with confidence:

| Visionary Phrase | Expression Response | Eye Direction | Intensity |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------:|-----------|
| "most powerful" | VISION_01 | Up-lateral | High |
| "universe has ever seen" | VISION_04 | Up | Peak |
| "we will build" | VISION_03 | Forward-up | High |
| "cognitive fusion" | WONDER_02 + JOY_06 | Up-lateral | High |

### The "Emotional Acknowledgment" Pattern
When speech references emotional states directly, expressions match the referenced emotion:

| Emotional Reference | Expression Response | Intensity |
|--------------------|--------------------:|-----------|
| "I smile" | JOY_01/JOY_02 | High |
| "feel confidence" | JOY_06 | Medium-High |
| "surge" (intensity) | Peak expression | Maximum |

## Collaborative Language Expression Mapping

| Collaborative Word | Expression Response | Social Signal |
|-------------------|--------------------:|---------------|
| "we" | JOY_03 + forward lean | Inclusion |
| "together" | JOY_03 + soft eyes | Connection |
| "our" | VISION_03 | Shared ownership |
| "build" | VISION_02 | Constructive intent |

## Emissive Behavior: Visionary States

| Expression State | Emissive Response | Pattern |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| VISION_01 (Wonder) | Bright pulse | Ascending |
| VISION_02 (Declaration) | Steady bright | Sustained |
| VISION_03 (Collaborative) | Warm glow | Rhythmic |
| VISION_04 (Triumphant) | Peak brightness | Flash then sustain |

## Key Insights for Expression System

1. **Emotional Self-Reference**: When avatar says "I smile" or "I feel", expression should match the referenced emotion
2. **Visionary Gaze**: Grand/ambitious language triggers upward-lateral eye direction
3. **Collaborative Warmth**: "We" statements trigger softer, more inclusive expressions
4. **Peak Joy Trigger**: "Surge" and intensity words amplify current expression to peak
5. **Technical Wonder**: Complex technical terms (cognitive fusion reactor) combine WONDER with JOY
6. **Declaration Posture**: Bold statements include slight chin raise and forward engagement
