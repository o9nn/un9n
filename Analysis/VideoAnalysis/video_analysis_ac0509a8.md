## Transcript Content
**Spoken Words:**
- "Executing dot optimize partitioning"
- "Partitioning optimized, performance increased by 17.4 percent"
- "Hypergraph interactions, recalibrating"
- "Execute rule, rules applied, structure adapted"
- "You're doing well, feed me more data, let me grow"

## Semantic Categories
1. **Technical/Computational Language**: "optimize", "partitioning", "performance", "hypergraph", "recalibrating", "execute", "rules", "structure"
2. **Achievement/Success Language**: "optimized", "increased", "applied", "adapted"
3. **Nurturing/Growth Language**: "doing well", "feed me", "grow"

## Affective Content Analysis

### Frame 001 (0:00-0:01) - "Executing..."
- **Expression**: JOY_01 (Broad Smile) transitioning to JOY_02 (Exuberant Laugh)
- **Features**: Wide open mouth, visible teeth, strong eye crinkle (crow's feet), head slightly tilted
- **Semantic-Affective Mapping**: The word "executing" paired with high joy suggests **anticipation of action** and **confidence in capability**
- **Morph Targets**: mouth_smile_L/R (0.8), mouth_open (0.6), eye_squint_L/R (0.5), cheek_raise_L/R (0.6)

### Frame 010 (0:05) - "Partitioning optimized..."
- **Expression**: JOY_03 (Gentle Smile) with WONDER_02 (Curious Gaze)
- **Features**: Closed-lip smile with soft eye crinkle, eyes slightly narrowed in satisfaction
- **Semantic-Affective Mapping**: "Optimized" and "performance increased" correlate with **satisfaction** and **pride in accomplishment**
- **Morph Targets**: mouth_smile_L/R (0.4), eye_squint_L/R (0.3), cheek_raise_L/R (0.3)

### Frame 020 (0:10) - "Hypergraph interactions..."
- **Expression**: WONDER_01 (Awe) blended with SPEAK_01 (Open Vowel)
- **Features**: Slightly parted lips, wide eyes, raised brows, upward gaze
- **Semantic-Affective Mapping**: "Hypergraph" and "recalibrating" evoke **wonder at complexity** and **active processing**
- **Morph Targets**: lip_part (0.4), eye_wide_L/R (0.3), brow_raise_L/R (0.2), mouth_open (0.3)

### Frame 030 (0:15) - "Execute rule..."
- **Expression**: SPEAK_01 (Open Vowel) with JOY_03 undertone
- **Features**: Open mouth for vowel formation, slight smile at corners, eyes directed laterally
- **Semantic-Affective Mapping**: "Execute" and "rules applied" convey **authority** and **systematic action**
- **Morph Targets**: mouth_open (0.4), viseme_AA (0.5), mouth_smile_L/R (0.2)

### Frame 040 (0:20) - "Feed me more data, let me grow"
- **Expression**: WONDER_03 (Contemplative) with subtle SPEAK_02 (Pursed Consonant)
- **Features**: Soft, distant gaze, relaxed mouth with slight purse, introspective look
- **Semantic-Affective Mapping**: "Feed me" and "grow" express **desire**, **hunger for knowledge**, and **self-actualization drive**
- **Morph Targets**: lip_pucker (0.2), eye_squint_L/R (0.1), brow_furrow (0.1)

## Expression Transition Sequence
1. **JOY_01/JOY_02** (High energy initiation) → 
2. **JOY_03** (Satisfied accomplishment) → 
3. **WONDER_01 + SPEAK_01** (Engaged processing) → 
4. **SPEAK_01 + JOY_03** (Authoritative communication) → 
5. **WONDER_03** (Contemplative desire)

## Semantic-Affective Correlation Patterns

| Word Category | Primary Expression | Secondary Expression | Emissive Response |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Technical verbs (execute, optimize) | SPEAK_01 | JOY_03 | Ear device pulse |
| Achievement words (optimized, increased) | JOY_03 | WONDER_02 | Facial markings brighten |
| Complex concepts (hypergraph) | WONDER_01 | FOCUS_02 | All emissives glow |
| Nurturing/growth (feed, grow) | WONDER_03 | JOY_05 | Slow pulse, dim |

## Key Insights for Expression System

1. **Technical Language + Joy**: When avatar speaks technical/computational language, pair with confident joy expressions (JOY_03, JOY_06) rather than neutral
2. **Achievement Recognition**: Performance metrics should trigger brief JOY_01 flash (microexpression mEXP_02)
3. **Complex Concepts**: Abstract terms like "hypergraph" warrant WONDER_01 with upward gaze (FOCUS_02)
4. **Self-Reference**: First-person statements about growth/desire shift to contemplative (WONDER_03)
5. **Emissive Synchronization**: Bioluminescent markings should pulse in sync with semantic intensity
