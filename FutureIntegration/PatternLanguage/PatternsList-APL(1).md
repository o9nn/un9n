[I. Independent Regions\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl001.htm)

Within each region work toward those regional policies which will protect the land and mark the limits of the cities:

[2\. The Distribution of Towns](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl002.htm)

[3\. City Country Fingers\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl003.htm)

[4\. Agricultural Valleys\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl004.htm)

[5\. Lace of Country Streets](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl005.htm)

[6 Country Towns\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl006.htm)

[7\. The Countryside\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl007.htm)

Through city policies, encourage the piecemeal formation of those major structures which define the city:

[8\. Mosaic of Subcultures\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl008.htm)

[9\. Scattered Work\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl009.htm)

[10\. Magic of the City](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl010.htm)

[11\. Local Transport Areas\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl011.htm)

Build up these larger city patterns from the grass roots, through action essentially controlled by two levels of self-governing communities, which exist as physically identifiable places

[12\. Community of 7000\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl012.htm)

[13\. Subculture Boundary\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl013.htm)

[14 Identifiable Neighborhood\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl014.htm)

[15 Neighborhood Boundary\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl015.htm)

Connect communities to one another by encouraging the growth of the following networks:

[16 Web of Public Transportation\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl016.htm)

[17 Ring Roads](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl017.htm)

[18 Network Of Learning\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl018.htm)

[19 Web Of Shopping\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl019.htm)

[20 Mini-Buses\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl020.htm)

Establish community and neighborhood policy to control the character of the local environment according to the following fundamental principles;

[21 Four-Story Limit\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl021.htm)

[22 Nine Per Cent Parking\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl022.htm)

[23 Parallel Roads](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl023.htm)

[24 Sacred Sites\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl024.htm)

[25 Access To Water\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl025.htm)

[26 Life Cycle\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl026.htm)

[27 Men And Women](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl027.htm)

Both in the neighborhoods and the communities, and in between them, in the boundaries, encourage the formation of local centers;

[28 Eccentric Nucleus\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl028.htm)

[29 Density Rings\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl029.htm)

[30 Activity Nodes\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl030.htm)

[31 Promenade\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl031.htm)

[32 Shopping Street\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl032.htm)

[33 Night Life\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl033.htm)

[34 Interchange](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl034.htm)

Around these centers, provide for the growth of housing in the form of clusters, based on face-to-face human groups;

[35 Househould Mix\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl035.htm)

[36 Degrees Of Publicness\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl036.htm)

[37 House Cluster\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl037.htm)

[38 Row Houses\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl038.htm)

[39 Housing Hill](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl039.htm)

[40 Old People Everywhere\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl040.htm)

Between the house clusters, around the centers, and especially in the boundaries between neighborhoods, encourage the formation of work communities

[41 Work Community\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl041.htm)

[42 Industrial Ribbon\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl042.htm)

[43 University As Marketplace](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl043.htm)

[47 Health Center\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl047.htm)

[48 Housing In Between\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl048.htm)

Between the house clusters and work communities, allow the local road and path network to grow informally, piecemeal

[49 Looped Local Roads\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl049.htm)

[50 T Junctions\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl050.htm)

[51 Green Streets\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl051.htm)

[53 Main Gateways\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl053.htm)

[54 Road Crossing](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl054.htm)

[55 Raised Walk\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl055.htm)

[56 Bike Paths And Racks\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl056.htm)

[57 Children In The City](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl057.htm)

In the communities and neighborhoods, provide public open land where people can relax, rub shoulders and renew themselves

[58 Carnival](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl058.htm)

[59 Quiet Backs\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl059.htm)

[60 Accessible Green\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl060.htm)

[61 Small Public Squares\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl061.htm)

[64 Pools And Streams\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl064.htm)

[65 Birth Places](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl065.htm)

[66 Holy Ground\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl066.htm)

In each house cluster and work community, provide the smaller bits of common land, to provide for local versions of the same needs

[67 Common Land\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl067.htm)

[68 Connected Play\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl068.htm)

[69 Public Outdoor Land](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl069.htm)

[70 Grave Sites\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl070.htm)

[71 Still Water\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl071.htm)

[72 Local Sports\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl072.htm)

[73 Adventure Playground](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl073.htm)

[74 Animals](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl074.htm)

Within the framework of the common land, the clusters, and the work communities encourage transformation of the smallest independent social institutions: the families, workgroups, and gathering places. The family, in all its forms;

[75 The Family\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl075.htm)

[76 House For A Small Family\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl076.htm)

[79 Your Own Home\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl079.htm)

The workgroups, including all kinds of workshops and offices and even children's learning groups:

[80 Self-Governing Workshops And Offices\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl080.htm)

[81 Small Services Without Red Tape\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl081.htm)

[85 Shopfront Schools](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl085.htm)

[86 Children's Home\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl086.htm)

The local shops and gathering places.

[87 Individually Owned Shops\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl087.htm)

[94 Sleeping In Public](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl094.htm)

[95 Building Complex\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl095.htm)

[96 Number Of Stories\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl096.htm)

[97 Shielded Parking\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl097.htm)

[100 Pedestrian Street\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl100.htm)

[101 Building Thoroughfare](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl101.htm)

[102 Family Of Entrances\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl102.htm)

[103 Small Parking Lots\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl103.htm)

Fix the position of individual buildings on the site, within the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important moments in the language.

[104 Site Repair\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl104.htm)

[105 South Facing Outdoors\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl105.htm)

[106 Positive Outdoor Space\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl106.htm)

[109 Long Thin House\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl109.htm)

Within the buildings' wings, lay out the entrances, the gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the volume of fhe buildings and the volume of the space between the buildings at the same time-remembering that indoor space and outdoor space, Yin and Yang, must always get their shape together;

[110 Main Entrance\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl110.htm)

[111 Half-Hidden Garden](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl111.htm)

[112 Entrance Transition\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl112.htm)

[113 Car Connection](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl113.htm)

[114 Hierarchy Of Open Space\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl114.htm)

[115 Courtyards Which Live\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl115.htm)

[116 Cascade Of Roofs\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl116.htm)

[117 Sheltering Roof\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl117.htm)

[118 Roof Garden\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl118.htm)

When the major parts of buildings and the outdoor areas have been given their rough shape, it is the right time to give more detailed attention to the paths and squares between the buildings

[119 Arcades\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl119.htm)

[120 Paths And Goals\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl120.htm)

[121 Path Shape\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl121.htm)

[122 Building Fronts\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl122.htm)

[123 Pedestrian Density\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl123.htm)

[124 Activity Pockets\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl124.htm)

[125 Stair Seats\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl125.htm)

[126 Something Roughly In The Middle](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl126.htm)

Now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the buildings: within the various wings of any one building, work out the fundamental gradients of space, and decide how the movement will connect the spaces in the gradients;

[127 Intimacy Gradient\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl127.htm)

[128 Indoor Sunlight\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl128.htm)

[132 Short Passages\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl132.htm)

[133 Staircase As A Stage](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl133.htm)

[134 Zen View\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl134.htm)

[135 Tapestry Of Light And Dark\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl135.htm)

Within the framework of the wings and their internal gradients of space and movement, define the most important areas and rooms. First, for a house;

[136 Couple's Realm\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl136.htm)

[137 Children's Realm\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl137.htm)

[144 Bathing Room\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl144.htm)

[145 Bulk Storage](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl145.htm)

Prepare to knit the inside of the building to the outside, by treating the edge between the two as a place in its own right, and making human details there;

[146 Flexible Office Space](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl146.htm)

[147 Communal Eating\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl147.htm)

[151 Small Meeting Rooms\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl151.htm)

[152 Half-Private Office](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl152.htm)

Add those small outbuildings which must be slightly in dependent from the main structure, and put in the access from the upper stories to the street and gardens;

[153 Rooms To Rent](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl153.htm)

[154 Teenager's Cottage\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl154.htm)

[158 Open Stairs\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl158.htm)

Prepare to knit the inside of the building to the outside; by treating the edge between the two as a place in its own right, and making human details there;

[159 Light On Two Sides Of Every Room\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl159.htm)

[160 Building Edge\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl160.htm)

[168 Connection To The Earth\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl168.htm)

Go back to the inside of the building and attach the necessary minor rooms and alcoves to complete the main rooms:

[169 Terraced Slope\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl169.htm)

[170 Fruit Trees\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl170.htm)

[178 Compost\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl178.htm)

Fine tune the shape and size of rooms and alcoves to make them precise and buildable:

[208 Gradual Stiffening\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl208.htm)

Within this philosophy of structure, on the basis of the plans which you have made, work out the complete structural layout; this is the last thing you do on paper, before you actually start to build;

[209 Roof Layout\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl209.htm)

[210 Floor And Ceiling Layout](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl210.htm)

[213 Final Column Distribution\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl213.htm)

Put stakes in the ground to mark the columns on the site, and start erecting the main frame of the building according to the layout of these stakes;

[214 Root Foundation](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl214.htm)

[215 Ground Floor Slab\*\*](https://www.iwritewordsgood.com/apl/patterns/apl215.htm)
