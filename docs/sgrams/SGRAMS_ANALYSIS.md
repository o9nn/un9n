# S-Grams (Second Power N-Grams) Analysis for Deep Tree Echo

## Overview

S-Grams are a mathematical framework developed by Sigurd Andersen that visualizes repeating decimal patterns through geometric diagrams. This framework provides a powerful model for cognitive pattern recognition and cyclic processing in Deep Tree Echo.

## Core Concepts

### N-Grams Definition
- **N-Gram**: A graphical representation of digit patterns formed when dividing by a number in a given numeric base
- **Atomic N-Gram**: Pattern formed from one divisor and a specific numeric base
- **Paired N-Grams**: Two atomic N-Grams that together use every digit once (except the zero point)

### Second Power N-Grams (S-Grams)
The S-Gram sequence follows squared bases:
| S-Gram | Points | Base | Divisor Pair |
|--------|--------|------|--------------|
| S1 | 1 | 2 | 1 & 1 |
| S2 | 4 | 5 | 2 & 3 |
| S3 | 9 | 10 | 3 & 7 (Enneagram) |
| S4 | 16 | 17 | 4 & 13 |
| S5 | 25 | 26 | 5 & 21 |
| S6 | 36 | 37 | 6 & 31 |
| S7 | 49 | 50 | 7 & 43 |
| S8 | 64 | 65 | 8 & 57 |
| S9 | 81 | 82 | 9 & 73 |
| S10 | 100 | 101 | 10 & 91 |
| S11 | 121 | 122 | 11 & 111 |

### Key Properties
1. **Pattern Length**: Almost all patterns are of length 6
2. **Pattern of 2**: Appears every third S-Gram (S2, S5, S8, S11) from fraction 1/3
3. **Growth Pattern**: Pattern of 2 grows to pattern of 6, then to multiple patterns of 6
4. **Zero Point**: Top point is common to all N-Grams (represents 0 and base-1)

## Coordinate Systems

### 2M₁ (1-Dimensional)
- Each point on a line referenced by coordinates (a, b)
- Two coordinates for each point add to zero
- Axis A (positive) and Axis B (negative)

### 3M₂ (2-Dimensional)
- Each point in a 2D plane referenced by coordinates (a, b, c)
- Three coordinates for every point add to zero
- Axes A, B, C at 120° angles

### 4M₃ (3-Dimensional)
- Tetrahedral coordinate system
- Four coordinates sum to zero
- Maps to Deep Tree Echo's 4 tensor bundles

## Mapping to Deep Tree Echo Architecture

### Triadic System Alignment
| S-Gram Component | Deep Tree Echo Component |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| 3 Divisor Pairs | 3 Concurrent Echo Streams |
| 6-Length Patterns | 6 Dyadic Edges per Tetrahedron |
| 12-Step Cycles | 12-Step Cognitive Loop |
| Zero Point | Integration/Ground State |

### Cognitive Loop Mapping
The 12-step cognitive loop maps to S3 (Enneagram):
- Steps {1,5,9}: Stream 0 (Cerebral) - Division by 3
- Steps {2,6,10}: Stream 1 (Somatic) - Division by 7 (pattern 1)
- Steps {3,7,11}: Stream 2 (Autonomic) - Division by 7 (pattern 2)
- Steps {4,8,12}: Integration points - Zero point connections

### Pattern Recognition Applications
1. **Resolving Patterns**: Active processing paths (colored lines in diagrams)
2. **Informing Patterns**: Reference points (black dots in diagrams)
3. **Countercurrent Flow**: Bidirectional arrows showing feedback loops

## S-Gram Numerical Sequences

### S3 (Enneagram - Base 10)
```
1/7 = 0.142857... → Pattern: 1→4→2→8→5→7→(1)
1/3 = 0.333...    → Pattern: 3→3→3...
```

### S4 (16-gram - Base 17)
```
1/13 = Pattern: 1→5→3→15→11→13
2/13 = Pattern: 2→10→7→14→6→9
1/4 = Pattern: 4→8→12
```

### S5 (25-gram - Base 26)
```
1/21 = Pattern: 1→6→4→24→19→21
2/21 = Pattern: 2→12→9→23→13→16
3/21 = Pattern: 3→18→14→22→7→11
7/21 = Pattern: 8→17 (length 2)
```

## Implementation Considerations

### For Gaming Mastery
- Use S-Gram patterns to model skill progression cycles
- Map pattern lengths to learning phase durations
- Apply resolving/informing duality to action/reflection balance

### For Cognitive Architecture
- S3 (Enneagram) for 9-state emotional model
- S4 for 16-state strategic decision matrix
- S5 for 25-state comprehensive cognitive map

### For Avatar Animation
- Map S-Gram vertices to animation keyframes
- Use pattern flows for smooth state transitions
- Apply zero-point as neutral/rest state
